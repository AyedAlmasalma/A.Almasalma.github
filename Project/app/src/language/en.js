        descriptionText: 'DNG Decoder is a project aimed at making working with Digitale Negative files easier by making the raw data that the camera collects, as well as the most important meta data used by the camera more accesible and easier to extract from the .DNG file. It converts DNG files into a viewable image format. Seeing as there is only so much knowledge about the .DNG format that has been found out, there are certain limitations as to what this tool can do and we cannot promise that it will work with every camera and every file that is uploaded. It is still a work in progress so a lot of improvements are always on the way.',
